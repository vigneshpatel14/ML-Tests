It is a technique that allows a program to perform multiple tasks concurrently, thereby increasing its efficiency and performance. In multithreading, multiple threads of execution are created within a single process, and each thread runs independently, sharing the same memory space. This allows different parts of the program to be executed concurrently, without blocking each other.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"dxIgXgV_T5zv"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#34.Create a thread in Python"],"metadata":{"id":"xEFQotnKT63F"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import time\n","import threading\n","s = time.perf_counter()\n","\n","def fun():\n","  print(\"Before\")\n","  print(\"sleeping for 5 sec\")\n","  time.sleep(5)\n","  print(\"Done sleeping\")\n","\n","\n","t1 = threading.Thread(target = fun)\n","t2 = threading.Thread(target = fun)\n","\n","t1.start()\n","t2.start()\n","\n","t1.join()\n","t2.join()\n","\n","\n","e = time.perf_counter()\n","\n","print(e-s)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"ODT4IBdxT6PE","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1716885130842,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":5560,"user":{"displayName":"VIGNESH PATEL","userId":"10594161131480717709"}},"outputId":"c67d7f67-3d50-489c-f1db-a76485fbb1cf"},"execution_count":52,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Before\n","sleeping for 5 sec\n","Before\n","sleeping for 5 sec\n","Done sleeping\n","Done sleeping\n","5.010621326000091\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#35.What is the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in Python"],"metadata":{"id":"jj9lo84TVAKW"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["The Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in Python is a mechanism that prevents multiple threads from executing Python bytecode at the same time.

Processes can add items to the queue using the `put()` method, and remove items from the queue using the `get()` method.\n","- **Shared memory:** Shared memory allows multiple processes to access the same memory space. This can be useful for sharing large amounts of data between processes, without having to copy the data between memory spaces.\n","- **Locks:** Locks are used to synchronize access to shared resources between multiple processes.
